        <h1>Week 3 Blog</h1>>

        <p>It is Week 3 of the assignment, so far things are looking good!</p>

        <p>For this week, we have finished our inception deck and also allocated roles.</p>

        <p>We discussed the timeline for the project and delegated the work accordingly.</p>

        <p>Below is an image of the roles we each have in this project.</p>
        <img src="images/roles_pfd.jpg" class="center">
        <P>As seen above, I am in charge of handling the insertion of data from Python to Microsoft SQL Server.</P>

        <p>This is an important task as the data of the employees such as their check in and check out time will be recorded and inserted into the database.</p>

        <p>This step is crucial when we link the RFID Reader to the Raspberry Pi, and the Raspberry pi to the computer.</p>

        <p>When the RFID Reader detects an employee walking past it, it records important data that can be used for business purposes.</p>

        <p>In the picture below, the tables and data for our database is shown.</p>
        <img src="images/db_pfd.jpg" class="center">

        <p>My groupmate Thian Ping is responsible for handling the creation of the database and tables,</p>
        <p>while I am in charge of handling the insertion of data into the database.</p>

        <p>I volunteered to work on the insertion of data into MSSQL through Python as I have not used python in a while and want to refresh my knowledge.</p>
        <p>More importantly, Python is one of the most used languages for data analytics, so handling this task will allow me to learn and gain more experience.</p>

        <p>One problem we faced was deciding what data was necessary and what wasn't. Thankfully, we got it all sorted out before the end of class.</p>

        <p>This week, I've learnt how to use Python together with MSSQL, and I've also learnt to brainstorm effectively.</p>

        <h1>Week 2 Blog</h1>>

        <p>It is Week 2 of the assignment and progress has been made!
        </p>

        <p>We have come up with a more elaborate and detailed structure for our idea. Below is a picture of what it will look like.</p>
        <img src="images/pfddiagram.jpg" alt="PFD Diagram" class="center">

        <p>As seen above, we have decided to use an RFID reader instead of an NFC reader.
            This is because the RFID reader we're looking at has a further detection range,
            making it perfect for our 'gantry'-like system.
        </p>

        <p>We plan to use a Raspberry Pi to handle the decoding of an employee's RFID card. Raspberry Pi seen below.</p>
        <img src="images/raspbpi.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi" class="center">

        <p>We will use Python and MSSQL to handle the receiving and inserting of data. Our basic goal for now is to get
            the Python and MSSQL database connected. Through my research, it seems that we need a Python Driver to communicate with
            MSSQL.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a link for the Python Driver. 
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/" target="_blank">Here</a>
        </p>

        <p>We have also found an <a href="https://gist.github.com/mattgorecki/6085344" target="_blank">already written Python Script</a> that reads an RFID card from a serial RFID reader attached
            to a Raspberry Pi. 
        </p>

        <p>Many advancements have been made in our 2nd Week, hopefully we can finish a prototype by Week 5 for the hackathon.</p>

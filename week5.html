        <h1>Week 5 Blog</h1>>

        <p>The hackathon is finally here!</p>
        
        <p>For day one of the hackathon, we wrote down our objectives, as seen below, and aimed to complete them by the end of the hackathon.</p>

        <img src="images/objectives.jpg" class="center">

        <p>Our first task was to get the Raspberry Pi up and running, which Zhi Wei took care of.</p>

        <p>The second task was to get the Python requests to work, which I was in charge of.</p>

        <p>For the third task, we had found out that AIDC wanted to provide cloud databases that required knowledge of PHP, Linux and MySQL.</p>

        <p>Since we did not have the cloud database yet, we did not work on third task.</p>

        <p>However, I did make a separate file for handling MySQL queries. It was almost the same code as MSSQL, except for using different syntax here and there</p>

        <p>The fourth task was to bind the Python/Raspberry Pi to the cloud database, but since we did not have the cloud database, we also did not work on this task.</p>

        <p>The final task was to connect the RFID Reader to the speaker module, which Zhi Wei also took care of, since it was related to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

        <p>For my task, as aforementioned, I was in charge of handling the manual insertion and deletion functions. Below are some pictures of what I have done.</p>

        <img src="images/python1.png" class="center">

        <p>In the screenshot above, this function does the insertion of data into the database. The parameters are included so that the function can be as dynamic as possible.</p>

        <img src="images/python2.png" class="center">

        <p>This is the employee menu, as seen in the picture. It can handle the insertion, deletion and selection of data.</p>

        <p>We also implemented a shift menu where users could perform the same functions but for the shift table instead.</p>

        <p>The purpose of these functions and menus is so that it is easy for a user to insert and modify data if needed, without having to use the database.</p>

        <p>Currently, this program only runs in the console. Moving forward, we will turn this console app into an app/website, with a better and more user friendly interface.</p>

        <p>Below is an image of our solution, drawn in a way that is easy to understand.</p>

        <img src="images/solution.jpg" class="center">

        <p>To explain, our gantry is a hands free one, which allows employees to clock into work without having to physically interact with the system.</p>

        <p>The user will hold an RFID card that has an RFID ID. When the user walks past the gantry, the gantry will detect the employees card.</p>

        <p>Once the card is detected, the Raspberry Pi sends data into the Web Server and also retrieves the employee's name and lets them know through a speaker whether they are on time.</p>

        <p>A data analyst can retrieve the data from the database to monitor who is early, who is late, and overall use this data to help the business.</p>

        <p>By the end of day 1, we completed about half of the tasks, as seen below.</p>

        <img src="images/objectives2.jpg" class="center">

        <p>On the second day, we found out that we wouldn't be able to get the cloud database on time, so we had to continue working with MSSQL.</p>

        <p>By the end of the second day, most of what we needed to do was solidified, as seen in the picture below.</p>
        
        <img src="images/overall.jpg" class="center">

        <p>For our presentation, some feedback we receieved were:</p>

        <p>1. Have a video demonstration showcasing what the product does</p>

        <p>2. Improve the UI/UX. (Use something other than a python console)</p>

        <p>3. Improve the flow of the slides.</p>

        <p>For our next presentation, which is the final one, we will definitely use the feedback and tackle our weak points.</p>

        <p>Overall, the hackathon was a really fun experience and it was a very memorable experience, being able to work with friends and enjoy activities.</p>

        <p>This week, I've learnt how to effectively work with teammates and handle work that is assigned.</p>

        <h1>Week 1 Blog</h1>>

        <p>I am in group 2 for this module, which consists of me, Zhi Wei, Daryl, Ye Xuan and Thian Ping.
        </p>

        <p>So far, our group has a basic idea of what we want to create and what we want to achieve.
        </p>

        <p>The goal of our idea is for employees to clock into work easily without having to clock their timings or scan their fingerprints. It will be done seamlessly
            with an NFC card reader whereby when they pass through a gate, it will record the name of the employee, time clocked in and other useful data.
        </p>
        
        <p>This data can then be used to create charts and other useful data visualisation diagrams to study, for example, which employees are late and which employees 
            did not work for a certain day.</p>

        <p>We have decided what language and software to use for this project. It includes Python which is responsible for handling the NFC card, Microsoft SQL Server
            to store the data of the card and person and Tableau for data visualisation purposes.</p>

        <p>One of the problems we are currently facing is our lack of experience with Tableau. It is a new programme for most of us in the group and I think
            it'll be a challenge to tackle moving forward.
        </p>

        <p>Overall for Week 1, we have mainly been doing research.</p>

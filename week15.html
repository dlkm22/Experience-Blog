        <h1>Week 15 Blog</h1>>
        
        <p>Back in school for this session!</p>

        <P>This week was quite 'quiet' compared to the other weeks as we are nearing the end of the assignment!</P>

        <p>We did the CRUD this week,  and I mainly focused on the creating/adding and updating/editing of data.</p>

        <p>Below is an image of our agenda</p>
        <img src="images/wk15agenda.jpg" class="center">

        <p>I had some difficulties with the syntax at first, as it has been quite long since we touched ASP .NET Core MVC.</p>

        <p>I learned that using Bootstrap makes formatting significantly easier and less tedious.</p>
        
        <p>Here is what the creating/adding looks like on the website currently.</p>

        <img src="images/wk15addemp.jpg" class="center">

        <p>As you can see, it's pretty simple but functional.</p>

        <p>The user has to enter the Name, ShiftID, RFIDID and FaceID in order to create a new Employee in the database.</p>

        <p>Shown below is the option to Update or Delete an Employee record after searching them up.</p>

        <img src="images/UpdateDelete.jpg" class="center">

        <p>If update is selected, this page pops up, which allows to user to modify certain data,</p>

        <p>such as their ShiftID, RFIDID and FaceID.</p>

        <p>We've made the assumption that the user is only allowed to modify the above data if needed.</p>

        <p>The presentation for PFD is over, and that means that the PFD module is completed!!!</p>

        <img src="images/finalpic.jpg" class="center">

        <p>I have learned so much from this module thanks to my amazing groupmates.</p>

        <p>Throughout this module, we've helped each other along the way and always made time to discuss the important things.</p>

        <p>For the final presentation, I believe we did the best that we could and I am very proud of the team.</p>

        <p>The lecturers mentioned that when I gave the elevator pitch I sounded like a minister. ðŸ¤£</p>

        <p>The feedback we received was very helpful, such as making the slides more appealing</p>

        <p>and also making sure that the content is short so that the audience can focus more on the speaker.</p>

        <p>Both the hardware and software demo went very well.</p>

        <p>The final product was a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a HuskyLens and RFID reader.</p>

        <p>Thanks to our groupmate Zhi Wei, we were able to host the website on a server.</p>

        <p>Albeit a little stressful, this module has been fun and useful for my learning.</p>
